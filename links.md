## WEEK 01

1. [45 Essential Linux Commands (with Examples)](https://www.tutorialworks.com/linux-commands/)<br>
New to Linux? Worry not. From ‘cd’ to ‘vim’, here are some of the most useful commands and programs in Linux!<br>
2. [devhints - Bash CheatSheet](https://devhints.io/bash)<br>
This link helped me a lot as a beginner on linux, especially to know all these weird and janky syntaxes that linux uses called Bash and what each everyone of them do is quite the challenge.<br>
3. [AWK FREE crash course](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/app/dojos/awk/)<br>
Though you need to create an account first to use its feature, but this website helped me learned all about awk! It is designed like SoloLearn or other programming language online courses!
So, it feels like a game and it made me learn it better!
4. [Regex CheatSheet](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html)<br>
A link that I found very useful in finding out more about Regex and very easy to understand in my opinion as a beginner on regex itself. Complete with examples and samples.<br>
