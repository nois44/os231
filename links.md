2. [devhints - Bash CheatSheet](https://devhints.io/bash)<br>
This link helped me a lot as a beginner on linux, especially to know all these weird and janky syntaxes that linux uses called Bash and what each everyone of them do is quite the challenge.<br>
3. [AWK FREE crash course](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/app/dojos/awk/)<br>
Though you need to create an account first to use its feature, but this website helped me learned all about awk! It is designed like SoloLearn or other programming language online courses!
So, it feels like a game and it made me learn it better!
4. [Regex CheatSheet](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html)<br>
A link that I found very useful in finding out more about Regex and very easy to understand in my opinion as a beginner on regex itself. Complete with examples and samples.<br>

Actually, this is the first video of a playlist containing 169 videos of C programming. Of course, you can't watch all those videos in just a few hours (or days, maybe). But, you can check out this playlist's videos if you encounter some topics in C programming that you don't understand really well.
2. [Cyber Security In 7 Minutes | What Is Cyber Security: How It Works? | Cyber Security | Simplilearn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inWWhr5tnEA)<br>

This website outlines the basic setup and use of GnuPG, and also serves as an introduction to the most commonly used commands. It gives you information about GnuPG’s background, installation, generating keys, encryption, decryption, and so on.
5. [Understanding OS Security: Threats and Security Controls](https://www.hysolate.com/learn/sandboxing/understanding-os-security-threats-and-security-controls/)<br>
This website explains the common OS security threats and how can we ensure the security of the operating system with a few ways to improve operating system security in the organization such as authentication measures, using one-time passwords, and virtualization.

## Week 03

1. [Linux File System/Structure Explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbgzrKJvDRw)<br>
The video will give you an overview of Linux File Systems! The speaker explains it so well! It is in English and a short video!
2. [Linux File Hierarchy Structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-file-hierarchy-structure/)<br>
The article is made by geeksforgeeks! It is easy to follow along. They explained the details so well. They even include photos to help!
3. [Bind command in Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bind-command-in-linux-with-examples/#:~:text=bind%20command%20is%20Bash%20shell,being%20pressed%20on%20the%20keyboard.)
A website that teaches me a lot about linux's bind command. I got interested in learning this since this could help me save a lot of time instead of typing something over and over again especially if a bash line is considered long. I recommended this since I believe it is very complete and very easy to understand, highly recommended.
4. [File Management - Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-management-in-linux/)
A website that explains common file management commands on linux, complete with explanations, examples, and demos. Personally, I think this website is really useful, informative, and really easy to understand.
5. [File Management Commands](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-file-management.htm)
An addition from the link above, this web explains in more detail about file management as well as providing more examples of file management commands on Unix/Linux. It is complete with easy to understand explanation and examples. Highly recommended.

## Week 04
1. [Logical vs Physical Address](https://eng.libretexts.org/Courses/Delta_College/Operating_System%3A_The_Basics/07%3A_Memory/7.5%3A_Logical_vs_Physical_Address)<br>
This source gives a good overview on the differences of logical and physical addresses, using a simple figure and a comparison chart to explain the concepts in a friendly way.
2. [Paging in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)<br>
This article helps me understand more about the concept of paging, used by operating systems to avoid external fragmentation, a problem that may occur in managing data. This source uses an example and figures to explain the topic.
3. [Segmented, Paged and Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9yZNLeOj4s)<br>
The speaker presents the topic in a simple yet effective way, explaining the topic of segmented, paged, and virtual memory, contrasting how data is stored in segmented and paged memory management systems.
4. [Difference Between C and Java](https://www.guru99.com/difference-between-java-and-c.html)<br>
Are you new to C programming language? If you've learned Java, then you might say that it almost looks the same (based on the syntax). The truth is that the two are very different in terms of program orientation. The purpose of this site is only to compare C to Java and not to give you the introduction to C language. For more learning materials, I suggest you to read "The C Programming Language (2nd Edition)" by Brian Kernighan and co-authored by the man who created the C language himself, Dennis Ritchie.
5. [Why use double indirection? or Why use pointers to pointers?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5580761/why-use-double-indirection-or-why-use-pointers-to-pointers)<br>
