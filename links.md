2. [Paging in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)<br>
This article helps me understand more about the concept of paging, used by operating systems to avoid external fragmentation, a problem that may occur in managing data. This source uses an example and figures to explain the topic.
3. [Segmented, Paged and Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9yZNLeOj4s)<br>
The speaker presents the topic in a simple yet effective way, explaining the topic of segmented, paged, and virtual memory, contrasting how data is stored in segmented and paged memory management systems.
4. [Difference Between C and Java](https://www.guru99.com/difference-between-java-and-c.html)<br>
Are you new to C programming language? If you've learned Java, then you might say that it almost looks the same (based on the syntax). The truth is that the two are very different in terms of program orientation. The purpose of this site is only to compare C to Java and not to give you the introduction to C language. For more learning materials, I suggest you to read "The C Programming Language (2nd Edition)" by Brian Kernighan and co-authored by the man who created the C language himself, Dennis Ritchie.
5. [Why use double indirection? or Why use pointers to pointers?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5580761/why-use-double-indirection-or-why-use-pointers-to-pointers)<br>
Why do we need a pointer to point a pointer that points to a variable with value in it? Is the question already confusing enough? Then try to read this to understand the purpose of it and how do you implement it in your program.

## WEEK 06
1. [Basics for Processes and Threads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv7mzX8w3jI)<br>
This is a video that describes the basic concept of what a process and thread is. This is a very good video for beginners that want to understand how it function and why we need processes and threads.
2. [What Is and How Does a Fork() Work?](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/fork-in-c-programming-language/)<br>
This is an article that explains about how fork() actually works, it also gives a really good coding example in C on how it actually can be practised. By the function, fork system call is used for creating a new process, which is called child process, which runs concurrently with the process that makes the fork() call, the parent process itself.
3. [The Difference Between Concurrent and Parallel Processes](https://medium.com/@itIsMadhavan/concurrency-vs-parallelism-a-brief-review-b337c8dac350)⛓<br>

3. [Critical Section Animation](https://youtu.be/6x_XMDCMyAk)<br>
The critical section problem is an issue where there is a resource that can only be used by one process at a time, but multiple processes want to use it. That concept is visualized with an analogy by the video above, which helps to understand the criteria/conditions for solving this problem.

4. [Operating Systems: Process Synchronization](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/5_Synchronization.html)
The page above is an excellent summary (though still very long and detailed) of the entire chapter of Synchronization, from its concept to different solutions like Peterson's Solution (software-based) and Semaphores (hardware solution). The page also includes snippets of C code to help us understand the problems and solutions in practice.

5. [What is a semaphore?](https://youtu.be/ukM_zzrIeXs)<br>
Aside from mutual exclusion (mutex), another approach that you can take in solving the critical section problem is using semaphores. The video above is quite informative and well-explained.
